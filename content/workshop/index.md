## Workshop: explanations meet uncertainties

### Abstract

Explanations and uncertainty quantification and handling in artificial intelligence models are (again) rising topics, due to their increased uses in everyday life as well as in sensitive areas and the need for trustworthy models and inferences. This satellite workshop of ECSQARU aim at gathering researchers that are interested in methods that include both aspects of trustworthy IA, in order to discuss recent advances in this direction.

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

* Robustness in explanations
* Approximate explanations
* Explaining uncertainties (epistemic/aleatoric)
* Reasoning and explanation
* Defeasible reasoning and explanations
* Causality and explanation
* (Weighted) argumentation and explanations

### Contributions

We welcome both abstract of presentations as well as longer papers of up to 6 pages. Papers will be sent for review to program committee members, in order to provide feedbacks to the authors. The goal of the workshop is primarily to present and discuss recent ideas about explanations and uncertainty handling, and we do not aim to have a selective procedure, unless the number of submissions becomes too high to have enough time for discussions.

### Important dates

* 15th June : submission deadline
* 15th July : feedbacks (in case of paper submission)
* 19th September : workshop day.
