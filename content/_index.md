### Welcome to ECSQARU 2023  

The 17th European Conference on Symbolic and Quantitative Approaches to Reasoning with Uncertainty (ECSQARU 2023) will be held in Arras (France), on September 19-22, 2023.  

Papers will be published within Springer the LNAI (Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence) series. In addition to that,extended versions of selected papers will appear in a special issue of the International Journal of Approximate Reasoning.   

Co-Chairs of the conference are [Zied Bouraoui](http://www.cril.univ-artois.fr/~bouraoui/), [Said Jabbour](http://www.cril.univ-artois.fr/~jabbour/) and [Srdjan Vesic](http://www.cril.univ-artois.fr/~vesic/) from [CRIL, Universit√© d'Artois - CNRS](https://www.cril.univ-artois.fr).    

### About ECSQARU  

The biennial ECSQARU conferences constitute a major forum for advances in the theory and practice of reasoning under uncertainty, with a focus on bringing symbolic and quantitative aspects together. Contributions come from researchers interested in advancing the scientific knowledge and from practitioners using uncertainty techniques in real-world applications. The scope of the ECSQARU conferences encompasses fundamental issues, representation, inference, learning, and decision making in qualitative and numeric uncertainty paradigms.   

Previous ECSQARU events have taken place in Prague (2021), Belgrade (2019), Lugano (2017), Compiegne (2015),  Utrecht (2013),  Belfast (2011), Verona (2009),  Hammamet (2007),  Barcelona (2005), Aalborg (2003),  Toulouse (2001),  London (1999), Bonn (1997), Fribourg (1995), Granada (1993), and Marseille (1991).
