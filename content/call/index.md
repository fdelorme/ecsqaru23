The biennial ECSQARU conferences constitute a major forum for advances in the theory and practice of reasoning under uncertainty, with a focus on bringing symbolic and quantitative aspects together. Contributions come from researchers interested in advancing scientific knowledge and from practitioners using uncertainty techniques in real-world applications. The scope of the ECSQARU conferences encompasses fundamental issues, representation, inference, learning, and decision-making in qualitative and numeric uncertainty paradigms.

### PROCEEDINGS 

In accordance with the previous conferences, the proceedings of ECSQARU 2023 will be published in the Springer Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence series. In addition to that, extended versions of selected papers will be published in a special issue of the International Journal of Approximate Reasoning.


### SUBMISSIONS

Authors are requested to prepare their conference papers in the LNCS/LNAI format. Submitted papers must be original and not under review in a journal or another venue with formally published proceedings. They will be evaluated by peer reviews based on originality, significance, technical soundness, and clarity of exposition. Authors of accepted papers are expected to attend the conference to present their work, at least one author of each paper must register for the conference.

Submitted papers must be at most 10 pages (excluding references) in the Springer LNCS/LNAI format. Submissions will be through EasyChair.
