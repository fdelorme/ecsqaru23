### On belief update according to Katsuno & Mendelzon: Novel insights.
Abstract: The aim of Belief Change Theory is to provide a formal framework for understanding how an agent's beliefs evolve in response to new evidence. Over the past 35 years, various operators have been proposed to handle different types of situations and evidence. The core of this theory consists of belief revision operators, which are designed to update an agent's beliefs based on more reliable evidence. The standard model is the AGM revision, proposed by Alchourrón, Gärdenfors and Makinson.

Another important class of operators are update operators proposed by Katsuno and Mendelzon in 1991 (KM-update). The difference between revision and update operators is that revision operators aim to correct an agent's beliefs, whereas update operators aim to incorporate the results of a change in the world, without presuming that the agent's previous beliefs were incorrect. This difference is often summarized as belief revision being concerned with changing beliefs in a static world, while update is concerned with the evolution of beliefs in a dynamic world.

 
In this presentation, we will showcase recent research that revolves around the KM-update model of belief change.
 
1. The model's efficacy in accurately capturing changes occurring in the world. We will introduce some philosophical and technical aspects on this point. KM-update assumes that any situation can be updated into one satisfying that input, which is unrealistic. To solve this problem, we must relax either the success or the consistency principle. We propose and characterize a model where not all the input are "reachable".

2. The interconnection between KM update and AGM revision. We will examine the relationship between these two approaches.

3. The iteration of update. We will explore the methodology of incorporating iterative updates, drawing inspiration from the work of Darwiche and Pearl of iterated AGM revision.

By delving into these areas, we aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of KM-Update and its associated research developments.
