### Targeted training in Profiles:  A belief revision perspective.
Abstract: Given a profile, sometimes it is necessary to determine a set of interactions, tasks, or pieces of training to transform the profile of a user into a target profile. This is the case, for example, in a rehabilitation system, or in systems where it may be convenient to change a user’s program interface in order to allow him to perform more complex interactions.
In these cases, the changes must be small, minimal or imperceptible. Abrupt changes in systems generally lead to rejections by the end-users or or directly are not possible .
This may be very relevant several areas where it is common practice to predetermine goals at the beginning of a training program. These goals are not easily translated into numerical improvements, therefore, the analysis of a cognitive profile and its evolution over time through belief revision dynamics will be a contribution to the explainable Artificial Intelligence field.
